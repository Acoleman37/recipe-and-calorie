* Eat better not less is an app dedicated to helping our users both find meals to cook, and track their calories. Our site has two sections.

* The first section allows users to look up different meals and find multiple recipes along with their nutritional information.

* The second section is dedicated to tracking what you eat. It can look up specific food items along with their nutritional information as well as showing you everything you ate along the way.

* In making our site we used html, css, javescript, jquery, moment.js, edamam api, nutritionix api, and materialize css
